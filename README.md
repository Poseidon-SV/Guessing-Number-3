# Guessing-Number

This is a python program that guesses the number you have chosen in your mind or you can guess the number the computer has chosen.

Basically there are three modes in it, before running the program you have to choose between 'guess(n)', 'comp_guess(x)' and 'computer(h)'.

## Mode 1 'guess(n)'
Before running the program you have to give computer the range as 'n' like :

```
guess(10)
```

In this case the computer will choose a number and you have to guess the number by entering the number in the terminal.

If your guess will be low then the terminal will show:

```
Sorry!! Your Guess is lil low, try again :)
```

If your guess will be high then the terminal will show:
```
Sorry!! Your Guess is lil high, try again :)
```

And if your guess will be correct then it will show:
```
"Yay!! The number {randNum} you guessed or entered is correct :D
```

## Mode 2 'comp_guess(x)'
Before running the program you have to give computer the range as 'x' like :

```
comp_guess(10)
```
In this you enter a number anonymous to computer and randomly chosen between the given range.

And after pressing enter, computer guesses the number and tells itself that the number is high, low or correct.

## Mode 3 'computer(h)'
Before running the program you have to give computer the range as 'h' like :

```
computer(10)
```
In this scenario you have to choose a number between the given range in your mind and have to tell the compuert that the guessed number is high, low or correct by entering ['h'], ['l'] or ['c'] repectively in the terminal
